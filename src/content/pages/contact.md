Trying to get in contact for a savvy developer, submit posts for "500 Words or Less" or just anything in general. I'm happy to talk.

Just send us a message using the form below.  Please refer to the 3 guidelines below for submitting posts:

1. Your article must be 500 words or less
2. You must include 5 reputable sources for others to research if theyâ€™d like to go further in depth
3. If something in your article is found to be factually incorrect, you consent to it being corrected

**Form is under construction, please email submissions to wkencel1@gmail.com**

Thank you!
