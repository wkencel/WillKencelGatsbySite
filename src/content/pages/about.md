I’m a software engineer working with talented teams to create cutting edge technology while maintaining values in sustainability and empathy to ensure we learn and grow together for many years to come.  

I'm experienced in Full-Stack development in Node.  You can usually find me in Javascript/Typescript either on the frontend using React or React Native with popular libraries, or on the backend in express.js/SQL/NoSQL. I also have a big interest in AI and DevOps.  I also enjoy building between different frameworks depending on the use case.

I hold a bachelors degree in both Physics and Music from Skidmore College and know a bit of python.  So mathematics, data structures and algorithms hold a soft spot in my heart.  It was these types of problems that interested me to start coding and later study data visualization.  If you're interested in Data Vis, I suggest you check out one of my personal hereos [Shirley Wu](https://shirleywu.studio/)

This mathematical interest also evolved in statistics and stemmed me to attend University of San Diego to get my Masters in AI. I believe Artificial Intelligence will be on the forefront of massive accomplishments in environmental sustainability, healthcare and many other fields in the coming years. I'm looking forward to developing more software in the field of deep learning with neural networks and the broader machine learning areas.

I’m also an avid fan of container-based and bare-metal virtualization.  The abstractions and executions of these complex systems are some of the most elegant parts of modern computing.  I presented a talk *Kubernetes: The Dynamic Symphony* through *SingleSprout's* featured Speaker Series and am hoping to work more on this technology this year.  I'm currently sharpening my knowledge by attending a postgraduate DevOps course at CalTech in Pasadena.  I think the future holds big things for scaling in the cloud.

As an empathetic engineer, I believe it’s important to give back to the community that supported me in my growth which is why I am a proud open source developer for OSLabs and GimbaLabs.

While my work at OSLabs is in creating an endpoint monitoring product (see Project Venus), I work with GimbaLabs to produce a library of open source developer tools to teach engineers how to interact with Cardano.  For those who don’t know, Cardano is a third generation blockchain that aims to democratize access to capital thereby helping level wealth discrepancy between 1st and 3rd world countries.

On my down time, I enjoy hiking with my mini Bernedoodle, Coda, practicing sustainability, rock climbing and researching new tech.  While I do have a few projects going on, I’m always looking to take on new and exciting challenges so feel free to reach out in the contact section if you’d like to discuss a project or position.



**Stay Sharp!**
