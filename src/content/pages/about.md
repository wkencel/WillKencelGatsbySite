I’m a software engineer working with talented teams to create cutting edge technology while maintaining values in sustainability and empathy to ensure we learn and grow together for many years to come.  

I'm experienced in Full-Stack development in Node.  You can usually find me in Javascript/Typescript either on the frontend using popular React libraries, or on the backend in express.js/SQL/NoSQL.  I also enjoy building between different frameworks depending on the use case.

I hold a bachelors degree in both Physics and Music from Skidmore College and know a bit of python.  So mathematics, data structures and algorithms hold a soft spot in my heart.  It was these types of problems that interested me to start coding and later study data visualization.  If you're interested in Data Vis, I suggest you check out one of my personal hereos [Shirley Wu](https://shirleywu.studio/)

I’m also an avid fan of container-based and bare-metal virtualization.  The abstractions and executions of these complex systems are some of the most elegant parts of modern computing.  I presented a talk *Kubernetes: The Dynamic Symphony* through *SingleSprout's* featured Speaker Series and am hoping to release a few more talks on these topics later this year.  I'm currently sharpening my knowledge by pursuing a few certifications in AWS.  I think the future holds big things for scaling in the cloud.

As an empathetic engineer, I believe it’s important to give back to the community that supported me in my growth which is why I am a proud open source developer for OSLabs and GimbaLabs.

While my work at OSLabs is in creating an endpoint monitoring product (see Project Venus), I work with GimbaLabs to produce a library of open source developer tools to teach engineers how to interact with Cardano.  For those who don’t know, Cardano is a third generation blockchain that aims to democratize access to capital thereby helping level wealth discrepancy between 1st and 3rd world countries.

On my down time, I enjoy hiking with my mini Bernedoodle, Leo, practicing sustainability and researching new tech.  While I do have a few projects going on, I’m always looking to take on new and exciting challenges so feel free to reach out in the contact section if you’d like to discuss a project or position.



**Stay Sharp!**
